## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) - Recommended for the easiest setup.
-   Alternatively, [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) is also a great option.
-   An API key for the **Google Gemini API**.

### API Key Setup

Our application expects the Google Gemini API key to be available as an environment variable named `API_KEY`. The execution environment where this code runs must have this variable pre-configured for the AI features to work.

### Installation & Running the App

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/edgtec-creative-ai.git
    cd edgtec-creative-ai
    ```

2.  **Serve the application:**
    This is a static web application. You can use any simple HTTP server to run it. Below are a few common methods.

    #### Option 1: Using Node.js (Recommended)
    The `serve` package is a simple and powerful tool for this.

    ```sh
    # Install serve globally if you haven't already
    npm install -g serve

    # Run the server from the project's root directory
    serve
    ```
    Your application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

    #### Option 2: Using Python
    Python comes with a built-in HTTP server, making it a great zero-dependency choice.

    -   **On macOS / Linux (with Python 3):**
        ```sh
        python3 -m http.server
        ```
    -   **On Windows (with Python 3):**
        ```sh
        python -m http.server
        ```
    Your application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

3.  **Open your browser** and navigate to the address provided by your server to see the app live!
